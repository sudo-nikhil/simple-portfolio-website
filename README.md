# 🌐 Simple Portfolio Website

This is a basic personal portfolio website built using only HTML and CSS. It features a clean and minimal layout, designed for desktop viewing. The website includes a **Home** page and a **Contact** page, making it suitable for showcasing personal or professional information in a straightforward way.

The **Home page** introduces the user with key sections such as:

* **About Me** – A short introduction or personal summary
* **Projects** – A list or gallery of past work or ongoing projects
* **Interests** – A brief overview of personal hobbies or professional interests

The **Contact page** includes basic contact information, allowing visitors to reach out easily. There is no form functionality or backend logic—just simple HTML structure to present your information clearly.

This project does **not include responsive design**, so it is best viewed on desktop screens. It's aimed at beginners who want to practice front-end development and understand the structure of a basic website using pure HTML and CSS. There are no external libraries, frameworks, or JavaScript files involved.
